# Factorio Defense
Turing-based RTS, Tower-Defense-style game inspired by [Factorio](www.factorio.com "Official Factorio Website") for my 11th grade final project.

Unlicensed.

Development began May 12, and ends June 12, 2017.

### Objective
In this game, one balances furthering production so as to escape the hostile planet on a spaceship with keeping the hostile inhabitants at bay by manufacturing, placing, supplying, and repairing turrets.

### Interface
The map, which shows the current location of turrets and aliens at the entrance to the player's compound, is displayed as a grid on the left side of the screen. On the right is a list of stats and a slidebar, which the player uses to allocate their production. Availabe resources are shown next to their position on the slider.

### How to Run this Game
1. Download [Open Turing](tristan.hume.ca/openturing) and the _Factorio Defense_ folder in this repository.
2. Open `Main.t` with Open Turing, and press `F1` or the `Run` button.
